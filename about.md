## 👨‍💻 Who I Am

Hi! I'm **Jenish Kothari**, a Software Engineer specializing in **distributed systems** and **cloud architecture**. I love solving complex problems and building systems that scale.

Currently, I'm working as a **Software Engineering Intern at Dell Technologies**, where I build cloud-native solutions. Previously, I was an intern at **Adobe**, where I gained valuable experience in large-scale system design.

## 🎓 Education & Certifications

### AWS Certifications
- ✅ **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate**
- ✅ **AWS Certified Developer - Associate**
- ✅ **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**

### Focus Areas
- Distributed Systems Architecture
- Cloud-Native Development
- Serverless Computing
- System Design & Scalability

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### Current Projects
- **Serverless Invoice Processing System** - A resilient pipeline handling 500+ concurrent requests using AWS Lambda, SQS, and MongoDB
- **Load Testing Infrastructure** - Tools and methodologies for testing distributed systems at scale
- **System Design Blog Series** - Documenting real-world engineering challenges and solutions

### Areas of Interest
- Distributed systems reliability and fault tolerance
- Cost-effective cloud architecture
- Performance optimization at scale
- Infrastructure as Code

## 💻 Tech Stack

### Cloud & Infrastructure
- **AWS**: Lambda, SQS, S3, EC2, CloudWatch, IAM, API Gateway
- **DevOps**: Docker, Git, Terraform, CI/CD
- **Architecture**: Serverless, Microservices, Event-Driven

### Backend Development
- **Languages**: Node.js, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Express.js, FastAPI
- **APIs**: REST, GraphQL

### Frontend Development
- **Frameworks**: Next.js, React
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Material-UI
- **State Management**: Redux, Context API

### Databases
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, DynamoDB
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Caching**: Redis

## 📈 Engineering Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Learning in public** - Sharing both successes and failures
- **Systems thinking** - Understanding how components interact at scale
- **Cost-consciousness** - Building efficient solutions (e.g., $0.28 for 500 requests)
- **Reliability first** - Rate limiting is a feature, not a limitation

## 📝 Why I Write

This blog is my engineering journal where I document:
- **Real problems** I encounter in production systems
- **Debugging processes** from bug discovery to resolution
- **Load testing results** with actual numbers and costs
- **System design decisions** and their tradeoffs

No theoretical fluff - just practical insights from building real systems.

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing:
- Cloud architecture patterns
- System design challenges
- Career opportunities in distributed systems
- Collaboration on open-source projects
